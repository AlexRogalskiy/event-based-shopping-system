## Introduction

This project is a proof of concept for an event based shopping system using Spring Boot and Apache Kafka. 
As a result of an article by Tobias Flohre, we want to implement the event based system described in the blog.
For more information I suggest you read up the article first.

The system is based on Movie Database by @TobiasFlohre.
